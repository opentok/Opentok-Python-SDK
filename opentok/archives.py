    :ivar created_at:
       The time at which the archive was created, in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.

    :ivar duration:
       The duration of the archive, in milliseconds.

    :ivar has_audio:
       Boolean value set to true when the archive contains an audio track,
       and set to false otherwise.

    :ivar has_video:
       Boolean value set to true when the archive contains a video track,
       and set to false otherwise.

    :ivar id:
       The archive ID.

    :ivar name:
       The name of the archive. If no name was provided when the archive was created, this is set
       to null.

    :ivar output_mode:
        Whether all streams in the archive are recorded to a single file
        (OutputModes.composed) or to individual files (OutputModes.individual).

    :ivar partnerId:
       The API key associated with the archive.

    :ivar reason:
       For archives with the status "stopped", this can be set to "90 mins exceeded", "failure",
       "session ended", or "user initiated". For archives with the status "failed", this can be set
       to "system failure".

    :ivar sessionId:
       The session ID of the OpenTok session associated with this archive.

    :ivar size:
       The size of the MP4 file. For archives that have not been generated, this value is set to 0.

    :ivar status:
       The status of the archive, which can be one of the following:

       * "available" -- The archive is available for download from the OpenTok cloud.
       * "expired" -- The archive is no longer available for download from the OpenTok cloud.
       * "failed" -- The archive recording failed.
       * "paused" -- The archive is in progress and no clients are publishing streams to the
         session. When an archive is in progress and any client publishes a stream, the status is
         "started". When an archive is paused, nothing is recorded. When a client starts publishing
         a stream, the recording starts (or resumes). If all clients disconnect from a session that
         is being archived, the status changes to "paused", and after 60 seconds the archive
         recording stops (and the status changes to "stopped").
       * "started" -- The archive started and is in the process of being recorded.
       * "stopped" -- The archive stopped recording.
       * "uploaded" -- The archive is available for download from the the upload target
         Amazon S3 bucket or Windows Azure container that you set at the
         `OpenTok dashboard <https://dashboard.tokbox.com>`_.

    :ivar url:
       The download URL of the available MP4 file. This is only set for an archive with the status set to
       "available"; for other archives, (including archives with the status "uploaded") this property is
       set to null. The download URL is obfuscated, and the file is only available from the URL for
       10 minutes. To generate a new URL, call the Archive.listArchives() or OpenTok.getArchive() method.
